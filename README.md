# üîê Secure Your Pixels: Image Encryption and Decryption Project üîì
**Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**  
A Python-based tool that enables the encryption and decryption of image files using a user-defined key. This project provides a simple and efficient way to secure images by converting them into encrypted formats and allowing users to decrypt them back to their original state.  

**Features:**  
- **Encrypt Images:** Convert images into an encrypted format using a customizable encryption key.  
- **Decrypt Images:** Restore the original image from the encrypted version with the correct key.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive command-line interface for seamless user experience.  
- **Security Focused:** Ensures the confidentiality of sensitive image data by encrypting it.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pillow (for image processing)  

**How to Use:** 
1. Run the program and choose between encryption or decryption.  
2. Provide the path to the image and specify where to save the encrypted or decrypted file.  
3. Enter the encryption key (integer) to secure or restore the image.  

This project was built during my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**, showcasing my skills in cybersecurity and Python programming.
